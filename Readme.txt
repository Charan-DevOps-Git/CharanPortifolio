Welcome to my PortifolioDear HR Team,

I hope this email finds you in good health. I am writing to remind you of the issue I previously raised concerning the non-crediting of my Provident Fund (PF) contributions to my Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) account.

Despite my earlier email and follow-up attempts, I have not received any response or update on the status of my concern. I understand that your team is likely handling various matters, and I truly appreciate your dedication and hard work.

As my financial situation is becoming more pressing, I kindly request your immediate attention to resolve this matter. The credited PF amount is crucial for addressing my current needs, and I am eager to facilitate a smoother process for withdrawal.

I appreciate your understanding and cooperation in resolving this matter promptly. Your assistance will greatly contribute to alleviating my current financial challenges.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
